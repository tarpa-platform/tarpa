## About

The TARPA application is designed to fit the needs of small- to medium-size research teams working with human subject designs, especially in research areas without the need for collecting PHI or other controlled data.  The platform was initially built by researchers and project coordinators with research backgrounds in psychological, socio-emotional, and behavioral research areas.

## Functionality

The TARPA suite of tools includes:

- A study calendar,
- Participant information management,
- Team member tasks,
- Checks for consistency at defined points,
- Tools for longitudinal studies,
- Advanced templates for events and tasks at defined points,
- Participant timeline and portal, and
- Granular role- and user-based access rights and permissions.

## Motivation

*Or, "Why not use [this other program]?"*

As researchers, we explored using many different project management and data collection platforms.  Because none of these were designed specifically with research management in mind, many fell short.  It felt like we'd need to use many different applications across different platforms which would have led to a disjoint, disorganized, and ineffective solution.  TARPA was designed to bridge the gaps between different project management tools with an emphasis on making participant management as smooth as possible, especially for studies with detailed protocols or longitudinal designs.

## Technology & Development

TARPA is built using the [Laravel Framework](https://www.laravel.com) for the server backend, [Vue.js](https://www.vuejs.org) and the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) frameworks for the user-facing frontend, and MySQL (or variants) for data persistence.
